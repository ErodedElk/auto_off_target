Potential issues/refactoring:
- unused self.srcnmap
- unnecessary line "self.static_funcs_map[f["id"]] = set()"
- can internal_types for given id have more than one outer type?
- basedirs seems to be unused at the moment
- functions _filter_out_known_functions and _filter_out_builtin_fucntions seem unnecessary
- line globals_ids |= self._get_globals_from_types(g_types) is unnecessary

- all_funcs_with_asm_copy is maybe not the best solution for adding asm to recursive query
- when dropping pointers what about double pointers/arrays
- _adjust_varlen_decl - is this ever the case?
- section_header parameter is unnecessary in _get_global_types
- matching keywords as strings may lead to unintended matches
